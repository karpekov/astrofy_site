        Born and raised in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EoUz39nPMM">St Petersburg</a>,
        one of the most beautiful cities in the world, I have moved around Erurope and North America quite a bit since then.
        I am currently residing in the United States, somewhere in between Atlanta,
        New York City, and the Colorado Rocky Mountains.

        I love telling stories using data and visualization tools,
        exploring the hidden patterns in structured and unstructured data,
        and opening-up the machine learning black boxes. I am currently working
        on several projects within the Explainable and Interpretable AI domain at Georgia Tech.
        I am also doing some awesome data science research with my colleagues at
        YouTube Music.

        During winter I try to spend as much time as I can in the mountains
        slowly advancing my snowboarding skills.
        On warmer days, I am learning how to row with the Georgia Tech Crew.
        All year around I am challenging myself doing CrossFit, with a focus on
        gymnastics and (more recently) Olympic weightlifting.

        I built this website using Astro web framework using
        <a href="https://github.com/manuelernestog/astrofy">Astrofy template</a>
        It's hosted on Vercel. I maintain it locally using VSCode and upload
        changes to GitHub. This whole thing cost me $0 to build and host!
